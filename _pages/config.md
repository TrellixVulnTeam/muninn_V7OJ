# Archive configuration

An archive configuration file is a text file that describes an archive. The
configuration file for an archive with id ``foo`` should be called ``foo.cfg``.

The configuration file format resembles Windows INI files in that it consists
of named sections starting with a ``[section]`` header followed by
``name = value`` entries. Each section will be discussed in detail below.

# Section "archive"

This section contains general archive settings and may contain the following
settings:

- ``database``: The backend used for storing product properties. The currently
  supported backends are ``postgresql`` and ``sqlite``.

- ``storage``: The backend used for storing product data. The currently
  supported backends are ``fs``, ``s3`` and ``swift``.

- ``cascade_grace_period``: Number of minutes after which a product may be
  considered for automatic removal. The default is 0 (immediately).

- ``max_cascade_cycles``: Maximum number of iterations of the automatic removal
  algorithm. The default is 25.

- ``namespace_extensions``: White space separated list of names of Python
  packages or modules that contain namespace definitions (see section
  "Extensions"_). The default is the empty list.

- ``product_type_extensions``: White space separated list of names of Python
  modules or packages that contain product type plug-ins (see section
  "Extensions"_). The default is the empty list.

- ``hook_extensions``: White space separated list of names of Python
  modules or packages that contain hook extensions (see section
  "Extensions"_). The default is the empty list.

- ``remote_backend_extensions``: White space separated list of names of Python
  modules or packages that contain remote backend plug-ins (see section
  "Extensions"_). The default is the empty list.

- ``auth_file``: [Optional] JSON file containing the credentials to download
  using muninn-pull

Deprecated settings:

- ``root``: The root path on disk of the archive when using the file system
  storage backend. Please use the ``fs`` section instead.

- ``use_symlinks``: If set to ``true``, an archived product will consist of
  symbolic links to the original product, instead of a copy of the product.
  The default is ``false``. Please use the ``fs`` section instead.

- ``backend``: Same as ``database`` (please use this instead).


# Section "postgresql"

This section contains backend specific settings for the postgresql backend and
may contain the following settings:

- ``library``: Python library used to connect to postgresql. The default is
  ``psycopg2``. The only other library that is currently supported is ``pg8000``.

- ``connection_string``: Mandatory. A postgresql connection string of the database
  containing product properties. The default is the empty string, which will
  connect to the default database for the user invoking muninn. See psycopg
  and/or pg8000 documentation for the syntax.

- ``table_prefix``: Prefix that should be used for all table names, indices, and
  constraints. This is to allow multiple muninn catalogues inside a single
  database (or have a muninn catalogue together with other tables). The prefix
  will be prefixed without separation characters, so any underscores, etc. need
  to be included in the option value.


# Section "sqlite"

This section contains backend specific settings for the sqlite backend and may
contain the following settings:

- ``connection_string``: Mandatory. A full path to the sqlite database file
  containing the product properties. This file will be automatically created by
  muninn when it first tries to access the database.

- ``table_prefix``: Prefix that should be used for all table names, indices, and
  constraints. This is to allow multiple muninn catalogues inside a single
  database (or have a muninn catalogue together with other tables). The prefix
  will be prefixed without separation characters, so any underscores, etc. need
  to be included in the option value.

- ``mod_spatialite_path``: Path/name of the mod_spatialite library. Will be set
  to 'mod_spatialite' by default (which only works if library is on search path).
  Change this to e.g. /usr/local/lib/mod_spatialite to set an explicit path
  (no filename extension needed).


# Section "fs"

This section contains backend specific settings for the filesystem storage
backend and may contain the following settings:

- ``root``: Mandatory. The root path on disk of the archive.

- ``use_symlinks``: If set to ``true``, an archived product will consist of
  symbolic links to the original product, instead of a copy of the product.
  The default is ``false``.


# Section "s3"

This section contains backend specific settings for the S3 storage
backend and may contain the following settings:

- ``bucket``: Mandatory. The bucket containing the archive.
- ``prefix``: [Optional] archive prefix within bucket.
- ``host``: Mandatory. S3 host URL.
- ``port``: Mandatory. S3 host port.
- ``access_key``: Mandatory. S3 authentication access key.
- ``secret_access_key``: Mandatory. S3 authentication secret access key.
- ``tmp_root``: [Optional] path where temporary data should be stored.
- ``download_args``: [Optional] JSON representation of boto3 download_file ExtraArgs parameter.
- ``upload_args``: [Optional] JSON representation of boto3 upload_file ExtraArgs parameter.
- ``copy_args``: [Optional] JSON representation of boto3 copy ExtraArgs parameter.
- ``transfer_config``: [Optional] JSON representation of boto3.s3.transfer.TransferConfig parameters.


# Section "swift"

This section contains backend specific settings for the Swift storage
backend and may contain the following settings:

- ``container``: Mandatory. The container containing the archive.
- ``user``: Mandatory. Swift authentication user name.
- ``key``: Mandatory. Swift authentication key.
- ``authurl``: Mandatory. Swift authentication auth URL.
- ``tmp_root``: [Optional] path where temporary data should be stored.
