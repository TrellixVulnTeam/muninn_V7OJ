# Links

Products stored in a muninn archive can be linked to other products in the same
archive (or even to products stored in a different archive).

A link between a product A and a product B represents a relation between these
products where product A is considered to be the source of product B in some
sense (and consequently product B is considered to be derived from product A).

This information is useful for tracing the origin of a given product. Also, it
is possible to (for example) automatically remove a product whenever all of its
sources have been removed. Or to export certain derived products and / or
source products along with a product being exported.
