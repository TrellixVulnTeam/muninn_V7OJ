## Archive Objects

```python
class Archive(object)
```

Archive class

The Archive class is used to represent and interact with Muninn archives.
It provides functionality such as querying existing or ingesting new
products. While at the core of the Muninn command-line tools, it can also
be used directly.

It is typically instantiated and used as follows:

    with muninn.open(archive_name) as archive:
        product = archive.ingest(file_path)

Please see the Muninn documentation for details about how to configure
a Muninn archive (and also set an environment variable so Muninn can find
its configuration file.)

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.attach"></a>
#### attach

```python
attach(paths, product_type=None, use_symlinks=None, verify_hash=False, verify_hash_before=False, use_current_path=False, force=False)
```

Add a product to the archive using an existing metadata record in the database.

This function acts as the inverse of a strip(). A metadata record for this product should already exist in
the database and no product should exist for it in the archive.

The existing metadata record is found by performing a search based on product_type and physical_name.

**Arguments**:

- `paths` - List of paths pointing to product files.
- `product_type` - Product type of the product to ingest. If left unspecified, an attempt will be made to
  determine the product type automatically. By default, the product type will be determined
  automatically.
- `use_symlinks` - If set to True, symbolic links to the original product will be stored in the archive
  instead of a copy of the original product. If set to None, the value of the corresponding
  archive wide configuration option will be used. By default, the archive configuration will
  be used.
  This option is ignored if use_current_path=True.
- `verify_hash` - If set to True then, after the ingestion, the product in the archive will be matched against
  the hash from the metadata (only if the metadata contained a hash).
- `verify_hash_before` - If set to True then, before the product is attached to the archive, it will be matched
  against the metadata hash (if it exists).
- `use_current_path` - Ingest the product by keeping the file(s) at the current path (which must be inside the
  root directory of the archive).
  This option is ignored if ingest_product=False.
- `force` - If set to True, then skip default size check between product and existing metadata.
  

**Returns**:

  The attached product.

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.auth_file"></a>
#### auth\_file

```python
auth_file()
```

Return the path of the authentication file to download from remote locations.

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.close"></a>
#### close

```python
close()
```

Close the archive immediately instead of when (and if) the archive
instance is collected.

Using the archive after calling this function results in undefined behavior.

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.count"></a>
#### count

```python
count(where="", parameters={})
```

Return the number of products matching the specified search expression.

**Arguments**:

- `where` - Search expression.
- `parameters` - Parameters referenced in the search expression (if any).

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.create_properties"></a>
#### create\_properties

```python
create_properties(properties, disable_hooks=False)
```

Create a record for the given product in the product catalogue.
An important side effect of this operation is that it will fail if:

1. The core.uuid is not unique within the product catalogue.
2. The combination of core.archive_path and core.physical_name is
not unique within the product catalogue.

**Arguments**:

- `properties` - Product properties
- `disable_hooks` - Do not execute any hooks (default False)

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.delete_properties"></a>
#### delete\_properties

```python
delete_properties(where="", parameters={})
```

Remove properties for one or more products from the catalogue.

This function will _not_ remove any product files from storage and
will _not_ trigger any of the specific cascade rules.

**Arguments**:

- `where` - Search expression or one or more product uuid(s) or properties.
- `parameters` - Parameters referenced in the search expression (if any).
  

**Returns**:

  The number of updated products

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.derived_products"></a>
#### derived\_products

```python
derived_products(uuid)
```

Return the UUIDs of the products that are linked to the given
product as derived products.

**Arguments**:

- `uuid` - Product UUID

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.destroy"></a>
#### destroy

```python
destroy()
```

Completely remove the archive, including both the products and the
product catalogue.

Using the archive after calling this function results in undefined
behavior. The prepare() function can be used to bring the archive back
into a useable state.

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.destroy_catalogue"></a>
#### destroy\_catalogue

```python
destroy_catalogue()
```

Completely remove the catalogue database, but leaving the datastore in storage untouched.

Using the archive after calling this function results in undefined behavior.
Using the prepare_catalogue() function and ingesting all products again, can bring the archive
back into a useable state.

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.export"></a>
#### export

```python
export(where="", parameters={}, target_path=os.path.curdir, format=None)
```

Export one or more products from the archive.

By default, a copy of the original product will be retrieved from the archive. This default behavior can be
customized by the product type plug-in. For example, the custom implementation for a certain product type might
retrieve one or more derived products and bundle them together with the product itself.

**Arguments**:

- `where` - Search expression or one or more product uuid(s) or properties.
- `parameters` - Parameters referenced in the search expression (if any).
- `target_path` - Directory in which the retrieved products will be stored.
- `format` - Format in which the products will be exported.

  A list with the export paths for the exported products (when a search expression or multiple properties/uuids
  were passed), or a single export path.

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.export_formats"></a>
#### export\_formats

```python
export_formats()
```

Return a list of supported alternative export formats.

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.generate_uuid"></a>

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.identify"></a>
#### identify

```python
identify(paths)
```

Determine the product type of the product (specified as a single path, or a list of paths if it is a
multi-part product).

**Arguments**:

- `paths` - List of paths pointing to product files.
  

**Returns**:

  Determined product type

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.ingest"></a>
#### ingest

```python
ingest(paths, product_type=None, properties=None, ingest_product=True, use_symlinks=None, verify_hash=False, use_current_path=False, force=False)
```

Ingest a product into the archive. Multiple paths can be specified, but the set of files and/or directories
these paths refer to is always ingested as a single logical product.

Product ingestion consists of two steps. First, product properties are extracted from the product and are used
to create an entry for the product in the product catalogue. Second, the product itself is ingested, either by
copying the product or by creating symbolic links to the product.

If the product to be ingested is already located at the target location within the archive (and there was not
already another catalogue entry pointing to it), muninn will leave the product at its location as-is, and won't
try to copy/symlink it.

**Arguments**:

- `paths` - List of paths pointing to product files.
- `product_type` - Product type of the product to ingest. If left unspecified, an attempt will be made to
  determine the product type automatically. By default, the product type will be determined
  automatically.
- `properties` - Used as product properties if specified. No properties will be extracted from the product
  in this case.
- `ingest_product` - If set to False, the product itself will not be ingested into the archive, only its
  properties. By default, the product will be ingested.
- `use_symlinks` - If set to True, symbolic links to the original product will be stored in the archive
  instead of a copy of the original product. If set to None, the value of the corresponding
  archive wide configuration option will be used. By default, the archive configuration will
  be used.
  This option is ignored if use_current_path=True.
- `verify_hash` - If set to True then, after the ingestion, the product in the archive will be matched against
  the hash from the metadata (only if the metadata contained a hash).
- `use_current_path` - Ingest the product by keeping the file(s) at the current path (which must be inside the
  root directory of the archive).
  This option is ignored if ingest_product=False.
- `force` - If set to True then any existing product with the same type and name (unique constraint)
  will be removed before ingestion, including partially ingested products.
  NB. Depending on product type specific cascade rules, removing a product can result in one
  or more derived products being removed (or stripped) along with it.
  

**Returns**:

  The ingested product

Products should have a valid remote_url core metadata field and they should not yet exist in the local
archive (i.e. the archive_path core metadata field should not be set).

**Arguments**:

- `where` - Search expression or one or more product uuid(s) or properties.
- `parameters` - Parameters referenced in the search expression (if any).

#### update\_properties

```python
update_properties(properties, uuid=None, create_namespaces=False)
```

Update product properties in the product catalogue. The UUID of the product to update will be taken from the
"core.uuid" property if it is present in the specified properties. Otherwise, the UUID should be provided
separately.

This function allows any property to be changed with the exception of the product UUID, and therefore needs to
be used with care. The recommended way to update product properties is to first retrieve them using either
retrieve_properties() or search(), change the properties, and then use this function to update the product
catalogue.

Argument:
properties         -- Product properties
uuid               --  UUID of the product to update. By default, the UUID will be taken from the "core.uuid"
                       property.

                       (default False)

<a name="muninn.archive.Archive.verify_hash"></a>
#### verify\_hash

```python
verify_hash(where="", parameters={})
```

error will be raised.

**Arguments**:

- `where` - Search expression or one or more product uuid(s) or properties.
- `parameters` - Parameters referenced in the search expression (if any).
  

**Returns**:

  A list of UUIDs of products for which the verification failed.
