# Using muninn

This section provides a brief overview of the available command-line tools and
describes how to create and remove a muninn archive.

## Command-line tools

Muninn comes with a number of command-line tools to interact with muninn
archives.

These tools are:
  - muninn-attach
  - muninn-destroy
  - muninn-export
  - muninn-ingest
  - muninn-list-tags
  - muninn-prepare
  - muninn-pull
  - muninn-remove
  - muninn-retrieve
  - muninn-search
  - muninn-strip
  - muninn-summary
  - muninn-tag
  - muninn-untag

Running any of these tools with the "-h" or "--help" option provides detailed
information on its purpose and usage.

For an overview of the expression language used by most of these tools to
select the products to operate on, see the section "Expression language".

# Creating an archive

The steps to create an archive are:
  1. Perform backend specific initialization (if required).
  2. Create a configuration file describing the archive.
  3. Run muninn-prepare to initialize the archive for use.

When using the PostgreSQL database backend, you need to create a PostGIS
enabled database that muninn can use to store product properties. Multiple
archives can share the same database, as long as they use a different table
prefix.

Depending on your PostgreSQL installation, creating a database could be as
simple as:

```
$ createdb [database name]
$ psql -d [database name] -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"
```

For Sqlite, muninn will automatically create the database file when it is first
accessed.

Next, you need to create a configuration file for the archive. See the section
"Archive configuration files"_ for details on the configuration file format.

Make sure the configuration file is stored somewhere on the configuration
search path (see section "Installation instructions"_). Move the file or update
the search path if this is not the case.

The final step is to run the ``muninn-prepare`` command-line tool to initialize
the archive for use:

```
$ muninn-prepare [archive id]
```

You should now be able to ingest, search for, retrieve, export, and remove
products using the corresponding command-line tools.

# Removing an archive

The steps to completely remove an archive are:
  1. Run muninn-destroy to remove all products and product properties
     contained in the archive.
  2. Remove the archive configuration file (optional).
  3. Perform backend specific clean-up (if required).

The first step is to run the "muninn-destroy" command-line tool to remove all
products and product properties contained in the archive:

```
$ muninn-destroy [archive id]
```

Next, you can optionally remove the archive configuration file.

If no other archives share the PostgreSQL database used by the archive you just
removed, you can proceed to remove the database: ::

```
$ dropdb [database name]
```
