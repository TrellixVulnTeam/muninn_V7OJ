# Namespaces

A namespace is a named set of product properties. The concept of a namespace is
used to group related product properties and to avoid name clashes. Any product
property can be defined to be either optional or mandatory.

For example, the definition of the ``core`` namespace includes the mandatory
property ``uuid``, and the optional properties ``validity_start`` and
``validity_stop``. The full name of these product properties is ``core.uuid``,
``core.validity_start``, and ``core.validity_stop``.
